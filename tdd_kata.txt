TDD Katas for detect-ranges and count

1. Create a function that takes a list as input and detect ranges and count elements in each range.
    a. create a function named 'detect_range_and_count_readings(input: List[int])' that takes list of numbers as inputs
    b. Add logic to detect range and count of elements in each range
    c. Return the result using a proper data structure
    eg: input = [1,2,3,5,6,7]
        ranges = i) [1-3] has 3 elements
                 ii) [5-7] has 3 elements

    d. Based on example, the appropriate data structure for the results can be dictionary of tuple, int i.e Dict[Tuple[int,int], int]


2. Create a function that takes the results from previous step and prints using csv format as below,
    eg: Range, Readings
        1-3, 3
        5-7, 3
